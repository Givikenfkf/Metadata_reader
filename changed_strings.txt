Object {0} submesh={1} material={2} uses UVs outside the range 0,0 .. 1,1 to create tiling that tiles the box {3},{4} .. {5},{6}. This is a problem because the UVs outside the 0,0 .. 1,1 rectangle will pick up neighboring textures in the atlas. Possible Treatments:

Modified:
This is usually fine as the stored data is usually backwards and forwards compatible.

[Added] ASCII 0x1b096e6
Modified:
However node data (not settings) can get corrupted between versions (even though I try my best to keep compatibility), so it is recommended to recalculate any caches (those for faster startup) and resave any files. Even if it seems to load fine, it might cause subtle bugs.

This happens when a new path is requested from the seeker when one was already being calculated.

Modified:
For example if a unit got a new order, you might request a new path directly instead of waiting for the now invalid path to be calculated. Which is probably what you want.

To explain in greater detail, suppose there are two meshes:

[Added] ASCII 0x1ba29dc
Modified:
- A single-brick mesh that uses a small UV rectangle in a brick-wall.png texture.

[Added] ASCII 0x1ba2a2f
Modified:
- A brick-wall mesh that tiles the same brick-wall.png texture three times.

[Added] ASCII 0x1ba2a7d
Modified:
If TextureBaker is used to bake a texture atlas that includes only the single-brick mesh (NOT the brick-wall mesh) and the "considerUVs" feature is used, then the TextureBaker will copy only the small UV rectangle (the single brick) with the brick-wall.png texture to the texture atlas.

[Added] ASCII 0x1ba2b9d
Modified:
THE PROBLEM: If one now attempts to use the same atlas in a MeshBaker-bake with the brick-wall-mesh, this will not work because the brick-wall mesh requires more of the brick-wall.png texture than was copied to the atlas. The brick-wall mesh needs the entire brick-wall.png texture tiled three times.

[Added] ASCII 0x1ba2ccb
Modified:
THE SOLUTION: To resolve this issue, both the "single-brick mesh" and the "brick-wall mesh" in the original texture bake, then the TextureBaker will copy the entire brick-wall.png to the atlas tiled three times. This atlas rectangle will work for both the single-brick mesh and the brick-wall mesh.Objects in List: Objects/equipment/WorldShareableItemObserved scripts have to implement IPunObservable.
